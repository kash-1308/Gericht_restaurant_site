# Gericht_restaurant_site
In this project, my expertise in HTML5, Jaavascript,, and CSS3 was pivotal in developing an interactive and usually appealing user interface. These  technologies formed the foundation of the website's frontend , ensuring that users had a smooth and engaging experience while browsing the menu, making reservation and placing orders.

# Key features

i) Used semantic HTML5 elemets like <\header>, <\nav>, <\section>, and <\footer> to strucure the website , ensuring that the content was logically organized and accessible for search engines and users.

ii) Employed CSS3 media queries, to amke the website fully responsive, allowing it to adapt the different screen sizes.

iii) Used Javascript to implement an interaction reservation system that ensures built in validation for user inputs, such as dates and email addresses.

iV) Minified CSS and JAVASCRIPT files to ensure faster load times, enhancing website performance, especially on mobile devices.
